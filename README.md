# PDA_HW6
Sixth Assignment from Brown's Graduate level Practical Data Analysis Course, Fall 2019. Course Taught by Dr. Chis Schmid.

# Goal
The focus of this assignment is model building and transformations of predictors. Students were asked to create a model for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) that considers nonlinear transformations (polynomials, step functions, splines, generalized additive models) for continuous predictors. Students tried  each type of nonlinear function and gave statistical support (e.g, by using a hypothesis test) for their final choice.

# Code
See attached files and code for a completed version of this assignment. Both PDF and RMarkdown are included.
